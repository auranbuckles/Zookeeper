# Zookeeper

Zookeeper is a simple Sinatra CRUD application that allows users to sign up as zookeepers, create animals, and purchase food to take care of their favorite animals.

To use this app, clone it. In your terminal or IDE, run `rake db:migrate`, `rake db:seed` (if you want to add the seed data into the database), and then `shotgun`. The app will by default be running at port 9393 (localhost:9393).
