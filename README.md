# Zookeeper

Zookeeper is a simple Sinatra CRUD application that allows users to sign up as zookeepers, create animals, and purchase food to take care of their favorite animals.

To use this app, clone it, run `rake db:migrate`, `rake db:seed` (to add the seed data into the database), and then `shotgun`.
